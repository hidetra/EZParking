We were successfully connected to the Firebase server and download the tool kit for this project.
There is a FirebaseAuth import in some of the login and logout page.
However, there are still a lot of bug need to be fix, and we are working on that.
As for the signIn and Register page, we can store and authenticate email and password directly to Firebase.
